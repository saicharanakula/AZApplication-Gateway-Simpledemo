**Additional Considerations**

Private Link: For more secure access, consider using Azure Private Link to connect your Application Gateway to the backend VMs privately.

Monitoring and Logging: Enable logging and monitoring for the Application Gateway to track the performance and troubleshoot any issues.

Autoscaling: Configure autoscaling for both the Application Gateway and VMs if needed to handle varying loads.
